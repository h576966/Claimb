## Response to Previous Rejection

Dear App Review Team,

Thank you for your feedback regarding the previous submission of Claimb. I have carefully reviewed your concerns about "copycat" content and have made significant changes to ensure full compliance with App Store guidelines while maintaining the app's core value proposition.

#### 2. **App Description Refinement**
- Emphasized "performance analytics" and "data-driven insights"
- Highlighted "competitive gaming" as the target use case
- Removed game-specific terminology from public-facing copy
- Focused on the technical and analytical value proposition

#### 3. **Compliance Documentation**
- Added comprehensive API usage compliance documentation
- Detailed technical implementation approach
- Clarified data source attribution and usage rights
